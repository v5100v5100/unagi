----hardware designs----
Hardware designs has 2 revisions. Check each docments.
ATmega16 or ATmega164P based design / PCB 1.x -> mcu16.txt
ATmega168 or ATmega168P based design / PCB 2.x -> mcu88.txt

PCB 2.x is a design to reduce the produce cost. The transfer rate is 
slower than PCB 1.x. Because ATmega168 uses PCINT port for interrupt. 
ATmega168 does not have empty IO pins. It's difficult to expansions.

If you assemble kazzo by yourself, we recommend PCB 1.x. We will not stop 
supporting PCB 1.x.
